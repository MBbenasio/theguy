                    The stadium was constructed by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, at a cost of US$ 21 million.[4] Construction began in March 1984, and was completed in January 1989.[5]</li>
                    <li> In 1990, the Rwandan Civil War broke out between the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a Tutsi rebel group, and President Juvenal Habyarimana's government forces.[6] The war ended in 1993 with a cease-fire and the signing of the Arusha Accords, which gave the RPF positions in a Broad-Based Transitional Government (BBTG) and the national army, and also provided for a United Nations peacekeeping force.[7][8] This force was known as the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), and was headed by Canadian general Roméo Dallaire.[9] UNAMIR's initial headquarters was in the Hotel des Mille Collines, but the upmarket hotel did not welcome the presence of soldiers, and Dallaire quickly sought an alternative location;[10] after some days of searching, UNAMIR chose the Amahoro Stadium, which was large enough to host an entire battalion of soldiers.[11] The headquarters was opened on 17 November 1993, with an official ceremony attended by Dallaire and President Habyarimana.[12]

                        The cease-fire ended abruptly on 6 April 1994 when Habyarimana's plane was shot down and he was killed;[13] the assassination served as the catalyst for the Rwandan Genocide, which began within a few hours. The interim government began killing Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu, in well-planned attacks across the country.[14] Tutsi civilians began seeking refuge in United Nations premises, and thousands of refugees gathered inside the Amahoro Stadium.[15]</li>
